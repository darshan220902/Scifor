# 1.What is the difference between a list and a tuple in Python?
'''list                                                  Tuple'''
# Lists are mutable                                # Tuples are immutable

# Lists consume more memory                        # Tuple consumes less memory as compared to the list

#The implication of iterations is Time-consuming   #The implication of iterations is comparatively Faster
