#What is the difference between a DataFrame and an RDD in Spark?

# RDD                                                                                  #DataFrame
#RDD is a low-level data structure in Spark.'''                                  #DataFrame is a higher-level abstraction built on top of RDDs and introduced in Spark 1.3. 

#It is a distributed collection of data that can be processed in parallel        #It represents data in a structured, tabular format with named columns, similar to a database table or a spreadsheet.

# RDDs do not have a schema or predefined data types                             # DataFrames have a schema that specifies the structure of the data

#RDDs require more explicit coding for data manipulation and transformations     #DataFrames offer a more user-friendly and SQL-like interface for data manipulation
